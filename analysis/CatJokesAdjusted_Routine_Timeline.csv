00:09,9,"I was snacking on some goldfish crackers recently—you know, the ones made from processed everything."
00:21,12,"Fake cheese, fake flour, fake color... which makes perfect sense when you think about it - it's a fake fish! It's not even gold. It's orange."
00:24,3,"But you bite into it, and it’s like: ‘Mmm, delicious... wait, is this even food?’"
00:27,3,Who cares! Parents throw these things on the ground for their kids to keep them busy for ten minutes.
00:41,14,"Meanwhile, my CAT—my CAT—is over there living the high life with gourmet cat food. I dump this can out onto a plate, and I notice this isn’t just fancy kibble; it’s like a seafood buffet. Tuna, salmon, tiny shrimp, and—wait, are those PEAS in there?"
00:45,4,Why are there peas in there?
00:48,3,Why are there PEAS in my cat's cat food?
00:54,6,"What’s going to happen here? Cat's gonna be like—'Oh, num, num, num. Oh, these peas are so delicious.'"
01:02,8,"I can’t let him outside where the garden is. He’s gonna be running through it. 'Oh my gosh, there’s a pea pod out here.'"
01:12,10,I must have died and gone to kitty heaven. Oh wait—what’s over there? Is that broccoli? Num num num num num. So delicious.
01:25,13,I'm passing by the catnip. I'm not even going to eat a big pile of grass so I can go back inside and throw it up on the carpet. I'm heading right over to the vegetarian section.
01:39,14,"No, that didn’t happen. The cat eats around the peas. He’s not dumb. He’s eating all the shrimp. He’s eating all the tuna, the salmon—what’s left behind is a big old pile of peas."
01:47,8,"And of course, in our day and age, we can’t waste anything because that would be bad."
01:52,5,We don’t want to throw away food. It’s bad for the environment.
01:59,7,"So, I eat them. I know, that’s how I get my veggies. They’re not bad."
02:09,10,"I mean, they take the slight flavor of shrimp because they’ve been in a can with shrimp for so long."
02:21,12,"But if I’m already eating fake cheese fish, I might as well have some shrimpy peas and convince myself I’m eating healthy."
02:27,6,I’m over here with a box of bottom-shelf snacks and leftovers...
02:37,10,and my cat’s basically eating a $25 sushi roll.
02:40,3,Who’s winning this game?
