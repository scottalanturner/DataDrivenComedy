00:07,7,"I was snacking on some goldfish crackers recently—you know, the ones made from processed everything."
00:10,3,"Fake cheese, fake flour, fake color..."
00:13,3,which makes perfect sense when you think about it - it's a fake fish!
00:26,13,"It's not even gold. It's orange! But you bite into it, and it’s like: ‘Mmm, delicious... wait, is this even food?’ Parents throw these things on the ground for their kids, teaching them how to forage in the woods in case of the apocalypse."
00:35,9,"Meanwhile, my CAT—my CAT—is over there living the high life with gourmet cat food. I dump this can out, and it’s like a seafood buffet."
00:40,5,"Tuna, salmon, tiny shrimp, and—wait, are those PEAS in there?"
00:43,3,Why are there peas in there? Why are there PEAS in my cat's food?
00:48,5,"What's gonna happen? Cat's gonna be like—Oh, num, num, num. Oh, delicious peas!"
00:51,3,"I can't let him outside. He’ll be running through the garden like, 'Oh my gosh, there's a pea pod out here!'"
00:54,3,I must’ve died and gone to kitty heaven.
00:57,3,Oh wait—what’s that? Is that broccoli? Num num num num num.
01:02,5,So delicious.
01:05,3,I’m walking by the catnip now...
01:08,3,not even touching it. Headed straight to the vegetarian section.
01:11,3,"No, that didn’t happen. Cat eats around the peas. He’s not dumb."
01:16,5,"He’s eating all the shrimp, the tuna, the salmon—leaves me with a big ol' pile of peas."
01:25,9,"And of course, in today’s world, we can’t waste anything, right? *It’s bad for the environment*."
01:28,3,"So, I eat them."
01:34,6,That’s how I get my veggies now—canned peas soaked in shrimp juice.
01:37,3,"But hey, I’m already eating fake cheese fish, right?"
01:42,5,Might as well throw in some shrimpy peas and tell myself I’m eating healthy.
01:45,3,I’m over here with bottom-shelf snacks...
01:48,3,and my cat’s basically eating a $25 sushi roll.
01:59,11,"And at this point, I’ve lost the plot. Am I eating cat food, or am I eating like a cat?"
02:02,3,"What does it even matter? We’re all just trying to survive, right?"
02:05,3,Maybe I’ll adopt my cat’s lifestyle.
02:15,10,"No stress, just all the fancy stuff, even if it’s hidden under peas."
02:18,3,I’ll just let the peas go... it’s the cat’s problem now.
02:27,9,"Meanwhile, the cat doesn’t care. He’s already moved on."
02:30,3,Probably laughing at me from the windowsill.
02:33,3,While I’m still here wondering how peas even got into the equation.
02:36,3,"But you know, I’ll take it. Fake cheese fish, peas, and all."
02:40,4,Because at least someone’s getting a gourmet meal in this house.
02:50,10,
