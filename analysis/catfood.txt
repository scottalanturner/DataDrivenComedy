I'm over here munching on those goldfish crackers that we all know and love. Not a real natural ingredient in it. Processed flour and fake cheese. Yellow number 50, it's so delicious. Oh, they're so just awful bottom of the barrel food nutrition. So cheap. Cats over here eating gourmet cat food because oh yeah, he's extra special. I'm opening up these cans. What, what is that? It's a little tiny, little shrimp. The cat's eating shrimp and tuna. I'm eating processed cheese in a form of a fish. It's not right. Something's wrong with that. And those cat food manufacturers, I don't know what they're thinking. Why are there peas in there? Why are there peas in my cat's cat food? What is gonna happen here? Cat's gonna try. Oh, no, no, no. Oh, this is, this is so delicious. I mistakenly let it out the garden. It's gonna be running through. Oh my gosh. There's like a pea pod in here. I must have died and gone to kitty heaven. I'm gonna, oh, what's over the broccoli? What is this? Oh, it's broccoli. That's so delicious. Not gonna be able to let the cat out of the garden and no, that would never happen. Why are they putting peas and cat food? The cat eats around him. He's not dumb. He's eating all the shrimp. He's eating all the tuna, what's left behind a big old pile of peas and of course, our day and age, you know, we can't waste anything because that would be bad. We don't want to throw away food. It's bad for the environment. So I eat them. I know that's how I get my bitch. They're not bad. I mean, they, they take the slight flavor of shrimp because they've been in a can with shrimp for so long.
